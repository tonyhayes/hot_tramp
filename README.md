# Prerequisites #
Note the following is expected to be installed globally


Download and install nodejs 

Make sure you have Node version >= 5.0 and NPM >= 3

Once you have those, you should install these globals with npm install --global (it seems like you may not need these as globals, so try installing locally first):

* webpack (npm install --global webpack)  -> Note for Windows: had to install local to project

* webpack-dev-server (npm install --global webpack-dev-server)  -> Note for Windows: had to install local to project

* karma (npm install --global karma-cli)

* protractor (npm install --global protractor)

* typescript (npm install --global typescript)
